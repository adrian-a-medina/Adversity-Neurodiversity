# Intersections of Adversity & Neurodiversity: ACEs' Association with Mental Health & the Buffering Role of Flourishing

This repository contains files relevant to a study investigating the relationship between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and mental health outcomes in children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and ADHD. The study specifically examines the moderating role of child flourishing behaviors—curiosity in learning, emotional control, and task persistence—on the effects of ACEs on mental health outcomes.

## Study Design

The study utilizes data from the National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH), focusing on children aged 6-17 with reported neurodevelopmental issues (N = 44,776, M<sub>Age</sub> = 12.2). This cross-sectional analysis examines ACE exposure and its impact on three primary mental health outcomes: anxiety, depression, and behavioral issues. The moderating role of child flourishing behaviors is assessed using interaction terms in logistic regression models.

## Data Collection

Key variables collected include:

- **Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)**: Derived from parent-reported experiences such as exposure to violence, household dysfunction, and discrimination.
- **Mental Health Outcomes**: Parent-reported diagnoses of anxiety, depression, and behavioral problems, confirmed by health care providers or educators.
- **Child Flourishing Metrics**: Based on parent-reported behaviors such as curiosity in learning, emotional control, and task persistence, which were used to develop a Child Flourishing Index.

## Analytic Approach

The primary analytic approach involved logistic regression models to assess the association between ACEs and mental health outcomes, with interaction terms to explore the moderating effect of child flourishing. Key covariates include age, sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.

## Goals

The study aims to:

- **Examine the dose-response relationship** between the number of ACEs and risks of mental health challenges in neurodivergent children.
- **Identify the protective role of child flourishing behaviors**, offering insights into resilience-promoting interventions for this vulnerable population.
