# From Risk to Resilience: Ecological Exploration of Psychopathology and Flourishing in Neurodivergent Children Facing Adversity

This study investigates the relationship between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and mental health outcomes in children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and ADHD. The study specifically examines the moderating role of child flourishing behaviors—curiosity in learning, emotional control, and task persistence—on the effects of ACEs on mental health outcomes.

## Study Design
The study utilizes data from the National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH), focusing on children aged 6-17 with reported neurodevelopmental issues (N = 54,528, M<sub>Age</sub> = 12.1). This cross-sectional analysis examines ACE exposure and its impact on three primary mental health outcomes: anxiety, depression, and behavioral issues. Interaction terms in logistic regression models are used to assess whether child flourishing behaviors buffer the effects of ACEs on these outcomes.

## Data Collection
Key variables collected include:

- **Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)**: Derived from parent-reported experiences such as exposure to violence, household dysfunction, and discrimination.
- **Mental Health Outcomes**: Parent-reported diagnoses of anxiety, depression, and behavioral problems, confirmed by health care providers or educators.
- **Child Flourishing Metrics**: Based on parent-reported behaviors such as curiosity in learning, emotional control, and task persistence, which were used to develop a Child Flourishing Index.

## Analytic Approach
Logistic regression models were employed to evaluate the association between ACEs and mental health outcomes, including interaction terms to investigate the moderating role of child flourishing. The models incorporated a comprehensive set of covariates, including child age, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, caregiver mental health, neighborhood conditions, and healthcare access metrics.

## Goals
The study aims to:

- **Examine the dose-response relationship** between the number of ACEs and risks of mental health challenges in neurodivergent children.
- **Identify the protective role of child flourishing behaviors**, offering insights into resilience-promoting interventions for this vulnerable population.
